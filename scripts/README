README
get_bandwidth.sh uses the iperf3 tool to calculate the bandwidth of the servers given as argument to the script.
The script takes 3 server(INTERNAL) IPs and writes the bandwidth value to ~/bandwidth file on the given servers.
To change the file to which the bandwidth value gets written, modify the output_file variable.

To run -
./get_bandwidth.sh <server1IP> <server2IP> <server3IP>

Example -
./get_bandwidth.sh 10.128.0.33 10.128.0.32 10.128.0.18

Output -
rksinha_cs_stonybrook_edu@ritz-cockroachdb:~/janus-gray/scripts$ ./get_bandwidth.sh 10.128.0.33 10.128.0.32 10.128.0.18
Running iperf server on 10.128.0.32
Running iperf client on 10.128.0.33
Bandwidth of 10.128.0.33=15.8 Gbits/sec

Running iperf server on 10.128.0.33
Running iperf client on 10.128.0.32
Bandwidth of 10.128.0.32=9.19 Gbits/sec

Running iperf client on 10.128.0.18
Bandwidth of 10.128.0.18=15.0 Gbits/sec

Prerequisites -
1. iperf3 should be installed on all the servers. To install - sudo apt install iperf3
2. ssh to internal IP address should work on all the servers. If it fails due to public key permission denied error -
   Add the public key of all the servers to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of all the servers.

Known Limitations -
1. The servers bandwidth should fall in identical range i.e. all of them either have Gbits/sec or Mbits.sec but not a mix.
2. The script currently works only for 3 servers.
